## Software Setup

To go through the course material on your own or at a workshop, you will need the following software installed and working correctly on your system:

- [Command line terminal (shell)](installation-instructions.html#command-line-tool) (such as **Bash**, **Zsh** or **Git Bash**)  
- [Git version control tool](installation-instructions.html#git-version-control-tool)
- [Python 3](installation-instructions.html#python-3-distribution)
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](installation-instructions.html#visual-studio-code) integrated development environment (IDE)

You will also need to [create a GitHub account](installation-instructions.html#github-account) if you do not have one already, make sure that you are able to log into it, and download the [Spacewalks data and analysis code](installation-instructions.html#spacewalks) which we will be used for exercises in the course.

Please follow the [installation instructions](installation-instructions.md) to install the above tools and set up for the course.
