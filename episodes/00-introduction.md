## Jargon busting
Before we start with the course, below we cover the terminology and explain terms, phrases, and 
concepts associated with software development in reproducible research that we will use in this course.

* **Reproducibility** - the ability to be reproduced or copied; the extent to which consistent results are obtained 
when an experiment is repeated (definition from [Oxford Languages](https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/))
* **Computational reproducibility** - obtaining consistent results using the same input data, computational methods (code),
and conditions of analysis; work that can be independently recreated from the same data and the same code 
([definition](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions) 
by the Turing Way's "Guide to Reproducible Research")
* **Reproducible research** - the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction
is fully transparent ([definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) from Wikipedia)
* **Open research** - research that is openly accessible by others; concerned with making research more transparent, 
more collaborative, more wide-reaching, and more efficient 
([definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research) from Wikipedia)
* **FAIR** - an acronym that stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
* **Sustainable software development** - software development practice that takes into account longevity and 
maintainability of code (e.g. beyond the lifetime of the project), environmental impact, societal responsibility and ethics in 
our software practices.

## Computational reproducibility

In this course, we use the term "reproducibility" as a synonym for "computational reproducibility".

## What is reproducible research?

[The Turing Way's "Guide to Reproducible Research"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html#citing-the-turing-way)
provides an [excellent overview of definitions of "reproducibility" and "replicability"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions) found in literature, 
and their different aspects and levels. 

In this course, we adopt the Turing Way's definitions: 

* **Reproducible research**: a result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same data 
consistently produce the same answer.
* **Replicable research**: a result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different data produces 
qualitatively similar answers.
* **Robust research**: a result is robust when the same data is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the 
same research question and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced.
* **Generalisable research**: combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results 
that are broadly applicable to different types of data or contexts.

In this course we mainly address reproducibility, as the first step towards generalisability 
(the ultimate goal of research).

We can also further differentiate between:

* **Computational reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and 
implementation details.
* **Empirical reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific 
experiments and observations. In practice, this is enabled by making the data and details of how it was 
collected freely available.
* **Statistical reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided, for example, about the choice of 
statistical tests, model parameters, and threshold values. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations.

In this course, we are concerned with computational reproducibility, i.e. when the application of computer science and 
software engineering is used to aid solving research problems.

## Why do reproducible research?

Scientific transparency and rigor are key factors in research. Scientific methodology and 
results need to be published openly and replicated and confirmed by several independent parties.
However, research papers often lack the full details required for independent replication. 
Many attempts at replicating the results of well-known scientific studies have failed in a variety of disciplines [reference].
This is called [**the reproducibility crisis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) - an ongoing 
methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce.

Reproducible research is a practice that ensures that researchers can repeat the same analysis multiple times with the 
same results. It offers many benefits to those who practice it:

* Reproducible research helps researchers remember how and why they performed specific tasks and analyses; 
this enables easier explanation of work to collaborators and reviewers. 
* Reproducible research enables researchers to quickly modify analyses and figures - this is often 
required at all stages of research and automating this process saves loads of time. 
* Reproducible research enables reusability of previously conducted tasks so that new projects 
that require the same or similar tasks become much easier and efficient by reusing or reconfiguring previous work. 
* Reproducible research has greater impact on professional lives of researchers through the 
ability to reuse and cite all research outputs - including code and data.
* Reproducible research is a strong indicator of rigor, trustworthiness, and 
transparency in scientific research. This can increase the quality and speed of peer review, because reviewers can 
directly access the analytical process described in a manuscript. It increases the probability that errors are caught 
early on - by collaborators or during the peer-review process, helping alleviate the reproducibility crisis.  

However, reproducible research often requires that researchers implement new practices and learn new tools.
This course aims to teach some of these practices and tools pertaining to the use of software to conduct 
reproducible research.

## Software in research
Software is fundamental to modern research - some of it would even be impossible without software [ssi survey reference]. 
From short, thrown-together temporary scripts to
solve a specific problem and help with day-to-day research tasks, 
through an abundance of complex spreadsheets analysing collected
data, to the hundreds of software engineers and millions of lines of code behind international
efforts such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Square Kilometre Array, there are few areas of
research where software does not have a fundamental role.

In the survey conducted by the Software Sustainability Institute in 2014 [ref], 
92% of researchers indicated they used research software [reference]. 
We define "research software" as software or code that is used to generate, process or analyse results of a research 
for publication. 
Even formulas in spreadsheets are considered code - they are a form of computer programming in that allow you to 
create, calculate, and change data sets in a number of different ways. 
So, software is not reserved for [computational science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science) 
(aka scientific computing) and “traditional” uses of computing capabilities and infrastructures (e.g.
simulations and computational methods) any more.
Nor its use is restricted to "hard" sciences - the use of research software is ubiquitous and 
fairly even across all disciplines [ssi survey ref].

Research software is also widely developed - researchers do not just use “off the shelf” software and
the majority of researchers develop their own. 
In order to be able to produce quality software that outputs correct and verifiable results and 
that can be reused over time - researchers require training.
This course teaches good practises and reproducible working methods that are agnostic of a 
programming language (although we will use Python code as examples) and aims to provide 
researchers with the tools and knowledge to feel confident when writing good quality and sustainable 
software to support their research. Typically, we think of such software as being **FAIR**.
