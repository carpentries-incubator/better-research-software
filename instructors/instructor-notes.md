## Sharing code between instructors

To keep the instructor's repository consistent, the first instructor can add the others as collaborators after they complete their first day of teaching.
Then each other instructor can clone down the repo and set up the virtunal environment before they start teaching.
It might be worthwhile to consider showing the learners this process at least once, so they can see how easy it is to share a software project if set up reproducibly.
